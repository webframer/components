# Webframe UI Styles

Webframe uses [CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) to style user interfaces. This way, you can dynamically adjust styles according to the chosen UI theme.

Your app can support many themes, besides the default light and dark modes.

The easiest way to create your own theme is to change CSS variables.
