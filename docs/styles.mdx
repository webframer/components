# Webframe UI Styles

Webframe uses CSS variables to style UI. This way, you can dynamically adjust the Look & Feel of the app according to the selected UI theme.

Your app can support many theme modes, besides the default Light and Dark modes.

The easiest way to create your own theme is to modify existing CSS variables.
