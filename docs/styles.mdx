# Webframe UI Styles

  A User-centered Approach to UI Styling
</Callout>

The built-in Webframe UI styles use {tailwindcss} **Tailwind CSS** in combination with {logo} **Webframe CSS**, which is differentiated by the {logo} logo icon in CSS preview.

### Similarity with Tailwind CSS

- [CSS variables](/docs/ui/styles/variables) to style UI. This way, you can dynamically adjust the Look & Feel of the app according to the selected UI theme.
- Style composition - Webframe has been fine-tuning the utility-first CSS like Tailwind since 2015, but with some differences inspired by [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/).

### Unique to Webframe Styles

- [Intuitive class names](/docs/ui/styles/classes) that match your intentions. For example, to align content to the middle and center it, add `className='middle center'`.
- [Semantic color](/docs/ui/styles/colors) variables with human-friendly naming conventions for a delightful DUX (Developer User Experience)
- Support for many themes, besides the default {light} **Light** and {dark} **Dark** modes. {glass} **Glass** effect is another slick choice.
- Switch between themes with ease. For example, just add `className='dark'` and the UI should look great automatically, without manual color fixes like Tailwind CSS.

### Custom UI Theme

The easiest way to create your own theme is to modify existing CSS variables.

For 100% bespoke UI/UX, create CSS styles for all [headless UI components](/docs/ui/components) that you use in the app, then import your compiled CSS file, instead of Webframe's built-in CSS.
