# Webframe UI Containers

A collection of UI blocks with predefined functionality and behaviors for creating user interfaces.

UI Containers are composed of [UI Components](components) to solve common use-cases in modern interfaces.

They abstract away the internal logic of building blocks, so that developers can create intuitive user experiences with ease.
