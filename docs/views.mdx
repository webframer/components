# Webframe UI Views

A collection of headless [UI Components](/docs/ui/components) and [Form Inputs](/docs/ui/inputs) combined into self-contained views to solve common use-cases in modern apps.

Webframe UI Views abstract away the inner workings of components into well tested user interfaces that follow UX design best practices.

They help UI developers build apps rapidly and achieve intuitive user experiences by reusing proven solutions, instead of reinventing the wheel.
