# CSS Classes - UI Styling

With Webframe Editor you can easily style reusable components, design UI Templates and build application screens with a drag & drop GUI (graphical user interface).

### Preview Intellisense

  <Image className='radius box-shadow-large' name='css-class-preview.png' style={{maxWidth: 'min(700px, 100%)'}} />

Webframe Editor features CSS intellisense, similar to Tailwind Intellisense for VSCode or WebStorm, but with comprehensive **CSS previews**.

This is great for team collaboration, because designers can browse available styles in the project without searching docs or digging in the source code.

#### How Does It Work?

Behind the scene, Webframe Compiler automatically creates CSS preview for all CSS classes found in your project. This includes Tailwind utility classes, Webframe Styles, and your own custom written CSS classes.

In the demo above, `.bg-primary` is a custom CSS class from [Webframe UI Styles](/docs/ui/styles). It has CSS preview generated by the compiler.
